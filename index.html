		<!-- About Me -->
		<p>It was my 5th grade California History class that got me hooked on innovative brand strategies. My constant curiosity of how a 150-year-old denim brand aged so gracefully and continuously caught the attention of generations around the world sparked my nonstop quest in testing brand and marketing tactics. With more than 8 years of experience, I have dedicated time on research and application to create user friendly experiences online, and created content to drive traffic to e-commerce websites.</p>

		<p>My experience in different roles, and in different industries, has given me the ability to accomplish any challenge given to me, but it all comes down to being able to provide value by doing the things I get excited to do, including (but not limited to) the following: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Design and maintain brand personalities through social media channels and online applications.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Create and design responsive and user friendly websites.</li> 
			<li>Manage web content including product photos and videos, and product descriptions.</li>
			<li>Develop marketing plans & manage social media calendars.</li>
		</ul>	
			<li>Expand brand awareness and increase sales.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Initiate conversations (B2B & B2C).</li>
			<li>Share content on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, & Pinterest.</li>
			<li>Contact and develop relationships with bloggers and industry professionals.</li>
			<li>Collaborate with re-sellers to meet sales goals.</li>
			<li>Represent brand at trade shows and other events.</li>
		</ul>	
			<li>Produce relevant content.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Organize photo shoots. From planning locations, booking talents, directing the shots, and editing.</li>
			<li>Develop blog posts & e-mail blasts to increase the number of online visitors.</li>
			<li>Write compelling descriptions for products to turn visitors into customers.</li>
			<li>Understand and forecast trends in Social Media</li>
		</ul>
		</ol>
